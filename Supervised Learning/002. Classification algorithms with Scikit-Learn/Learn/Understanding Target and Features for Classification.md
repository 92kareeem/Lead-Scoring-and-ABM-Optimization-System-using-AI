## Understanding Target and Features for Classification
During this lab, we will practice your skills in identifying target and feature variables for classification problems.

When identifying the target and features for a classification problem, it's important to consider the following:

Target Variable: The target variable represents the outcome or the variable you want to predict. It should be well-defined and directly related to the problem you are trying to solve. Examples of target variables can be "Fraudulent Transaction" (whether a transaction is fraudulent), or "Loan Default" (whether a borrower will default on a loan).

Features Variables: Features, also known as independent variables or predictors, are the characteristics or attributes that you will use to make predictions or classifications. These variables should be relevant to the target variable and provide valuable information for the prediction task.

The process of identifying the target and features requires a combination of domain knowledge, data analysis, and understanding of the problem context. It's important to continuously evaluate and refine your selection to improve the performance of the classification model.

We will separate this project into two sections:

in one, you will respond to questions, and in the other, you will have the opportunity to practice. In the question section, you will demonstrate your understanding of target and feature variables in classification problems through your responses.

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, and it involves categorizing data into different classes or categories. Binary classification is a fundamental technique in machine learning where the goal is to classify data into two distinct classes or categories. On the other hand, multiclass classification expands the scope by allowing the classification of data into more than two classes, enabling the analysis and prediction of a broader range of outcomes.

Now it's time to Practice!

Framingham Risk Score

The Framingham_10yrs dataset comprises a range of features that encompass medical and lifestyle factors of individuals. The dataset provides valuable insights into the health profile of the subjects and can be utilized for diverse analytical purposes.

The dataset you will be using contains the following features:
